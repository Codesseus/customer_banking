# Python Challenge 2: Customer Banking

## Overview
This program calculates the total change to balance for both a savings account and a cd with inputted interest rates and time.

## Usage
1. After launching the program first prompts the user to enter information about the savings account. The first of these is inputting the starting balance for the savings account.

2. After that the user is prompted to enter the interest rate for the savings account. If the user inputs an invalid amount (such as a letter or other non-digit character) then the user is reminded that only digits are valid and is prompted to try again.

3. Thirdly the user is prompted to enter the amount of time in months to calculate the interest over. If the user inputs an invalid amount (such as a letter or other non-digit character) then the user is reminded that only digits are valid and is prompted to try again.

4. The program then calcualtes the amount of interest earned and the new savings account balance and prints those values to the screen. If the user inputs an invalid amount (such as a letter or other non-digit character) then the user is reminded that only digits are valid and is prompted to try again.

5. The user is then prompted to enter information about the cd account, following the same steps as the savings (input starting balance, interest rate, and length of time in months).

6. Once the user has input the information for the cd account, the program calculates the interest earned and the new balance and prints those values to the screen.
